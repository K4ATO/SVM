# SVM
### steps:
#### 1. Select features which lead us to our `target`.
* For predicting `target` in our dataset, we need to consider 2 features from our dataset to deal with.
* Our features are `trestbps, ca`.
* We can change the features to test different accuracy.
#### 2. Prepare the Data.
* Select features and target from the dataset file.
* shuffeling the data.
* Normalize the data.
* Separate the data to `training data` and `testing data`.
* Initialize w1, w2 matrix.

#### 5. Implement the gradient descent (train)

#### 6. Predict `target` values . 
* with feature1, feature2, w1 and w2 data and theta using the hypothesis function we can predict our `target` and compare it with our Y_test.
#### 7. calculate accuracy.
